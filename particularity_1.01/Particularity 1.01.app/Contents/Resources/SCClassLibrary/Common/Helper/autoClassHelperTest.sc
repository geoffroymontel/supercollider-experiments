	/*@
	shortDesc: A class to test automatic documentation from source
	longDesc: The only limit of this tag is that it cannot break a line. This can be cumbersone, indeed. You can use <br> blocks. You will see that you have to specify in the source what you want to document. Note in any case that for specified args in method the default value is extracted automatically. Works with the Class template (no sense for UGens).
	seeAlso: Homunculus, Leviathan
	issues: Caution! Frailty thy name is AutoClassHelper. You can omit tags but in order to have it running you cannot change their order. More, it works only for the first class defined in a source file. Note also that actually it assumes that you have one class for sourcefile.  It crashes if there's no class desc block. If method block descriptions are not indented as demonstrated they are not recognized properly. <br> Please use conventions specified in this class source file.
	testvar: nothing special
	classtestvar: really interesting
	instDesc: How to become an anthropogenist
	longInstDesc: It's easy. Consider using the following methods.
